Emart
===============

This application is the result of the COMP208 module for BSC in Computer Science, University of Liverpool (Spring, 2012). We were a team of three people where I was the sole developer and project leader. Implementation took a total of two weeks as such the front-end isn't perfect. 

The project involved creating a web interface incorporating a database for customers to browse and purchase products online from a ficticious store called eMart.

Full project details including Requirements, Design, and Evaluation can be found in 'Final Report.pdf'
